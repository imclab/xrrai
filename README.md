# XRAI Format Specification

XRAI (eXtended Reality AI) is an open universal file format designed for real-time interactive spatial media that seamlessly bridges current technologies with future AI-driven XR experiences. It enables dynamic, collaborative 3D/4D content delivery across web, mobile, AR, VR, and emerging wearable devices.

## Overview

This repository contains the technical specification and example implementations for the XRAI format, a next-generation standard for AI+XR spatial media that is:

- **Fast & Lightweight**: Optimized for real-time streaming and rendering
- **AI-Driven**: Native support for neural networks, procedural generation, and context-aware adaptation
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with web, mobile, AR, VR, and future devices
- **Future-Ready**: Designed for emerging technologies like neural interfaces and holographic displays
- **Open Standard**: Community-driven development with transparent governance
