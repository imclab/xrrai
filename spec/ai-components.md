# XRAI Format: AI Components Specification

## 1. Overview

The AI components in the XRAI format enable intelligent, adaptive, and context-aware spatial experiences. This specification details how neural networks, procedural generation, and adaptive systems are integrated into the format to create dynamic content that responds to users, environments, and hardware capabilities.

## 2. AI Components in XRAI Format Structure

AI components are stored in a dedicated section within the XRAI binary format, following the schema defined in `schemas/xrai-core.json`. The AI components section is identified by the section type ID 6 in the binary format.

```json
{
  "aiComponents": {
    "adaptationRules": [
      {
        "id": "string",
        "condition": "string",
        "action": "string",
        "priority": 0
      }
    ],
    "behaviorModels": [
      {
        "id": "string",
        "type": "string",
        "inputs": ["string"],

        "outputShape": [0, 0, 0]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The AI components are organized into the following categories:
